# Secure-Energy-Harvesting-from-Footsteps-and-Thermal-Gradients
The rapid depletion of non-renewable energy resources necessitates 	the development of sustainable and innovative energy extraction 	methods, such as hybrid systems combining piezoelectric and 	thermoelectric generators, integrated with RFID-secured solutions for 	efficient and secure mobile charging.

objectives:
Create a hybrid energy harvesting system that combines footstep and thermal energy for sustainable power generation.
Make the system adaptable to various climates by utilizing natural and artificial temperature differences for thermoelectric generation.
Implement IoT-based monitoring to track energy generation and optimize the system in real-time.
Develop a mechanism for storing harvested energy to provide consistent power supply.
Offer a renewable and eco-friendly alternative to non-renewable energy sources for public spaces and smart cities.
Ensure the system provides secure energy access, supporting both sustainable and safe energy solutions.
Innovation in Power Generation: To show how human activity may produce power using
piezoelectric technology or other mechanisms.
